Savage Worlds Adventurer Edition Dynamic Character sheet

This sheet will use a database created using [Airtable](https://airtable.com/)

Initially it will just supply some quick lookup stuff for the spells, skills, and edges. Eventually I want to turn it in to a full character sheet that will track the characters abilities - something like what D&D Beyond did with theirs.
